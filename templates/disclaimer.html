                license agreement and warranty.
            </p>

            <p>
                By receiving, opening the file package, and/or using Sequoia("Software") containing this software, you agree that this End

            <h2>3. USER AGREEMENT</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Use</h3>

            <p>
                Your license to use Sequoia is limited to the number of licenses purchased by you. You shall not allow others to use, copy
                or evaluate copies of Sequoia.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Use Restrictions</h3>

            <p>
                You shall use Sequoia in compliance with all applicable laws and not for any unlawful purpose. Without limiting the foregoing,
                use, display or distribution of Sequoia together with material that is pornographic, racist, vulgar, obscene,
                defamatory, libelous, abusive, promoting hatred, discriminating or displaying prejudice based on religion,
                ethnic heritage, race, sexual orientation or age is strictly prohibited.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each licensed copy of Sequoia may be used on one single computer location by one user. Use of Sequoia means that you have
                loaded, installed, or run Sequoia on a computer or similar device. If you install Sequoia onto a multi-user
                platform, server or network, each and every individual user of Sequoia must be licensed separately.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may not make any copy of Sequoia for any purpose without the prior written consent of Rohan Baddi. The assignment, sublicense,
                networking, sale, or distribution of copies of Sequoia are strictly forbidden without the prior written consent
                of Rohan Baddi. It is a violation of this agreement to assign, sell, share, loan, rent, lease, borrow, network
                or transfer the use of Sequoia. If any person other than yourself uses Sequoia registered in your name, regardless
                of whether it is at the same time or different times, then this agreement is being violated and you are responsible
                for that violation!
            </p>
